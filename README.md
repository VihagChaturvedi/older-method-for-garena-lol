# This is repo is mainly listing the old README.md files of the original repo
# No images have been added at the moment, pls be patient, it will be updated soon


## Those who cannot start LOL after the 11.17 update check here: Update to newer wine-lol version
## Instructions for getting the latest wine-lol are here
## You can also refer to r/leagueoflinux for frequent updates regarding the game on linux
## Note: This is the way I personally use to start LOL on Linux, through lutris. The code for starting game without Lutris is still in the script though

Follow Lutris official docs here: https://lutris.net/downloads/
Install Garena and LOL from Lutris

### Garena: https://lutris.net/games/garena/

Note for Garena: After installing Garena, do not login, close the window

LOL: https://lutris.net/games/league-of-legends/

Note for LOL: when the installer for LOL NA comes up, just close it, you don't need to install it, we just need the environment
Install LOL from Garena

Open Garena from lutris and install LOL like you normally do on Windows.

Also, enable Disable proxy when browsing for better Garena experience (it sucks by default)

(image holder)
### Config LOL Lutris

Change the default Executable in Riot LOL(the default LOL Installation for Lutris) to LeagueClient.exe (thanks to abiswas97) from the LOL-Garena installed location. For example:

    /home/nhubao/Games/league-of-legends/drive_c/Games/32787/LeagueClient/LeagueClient.exe


### Start the game

    Download the python script (lol.py)
    Install the dependencies:

pip3 install psutil pyyaml

    Start Garena
    Open terminal, cd into the directory where you have saved this project(Ex: /home/nhubao/league-of-legends-linux-garena-script-main) and run the script

python3 lol.py

    Return to Garena and press Play
    Wait for a while, it may take some time load in

### Result
(image holder)
LOL on Linux
Update new wine-lol (This is not the wine-lol package in the AUR)

    It currently only have prebuilt for Ubuntu/Debian based and PKGBUILD for arch based: https://github.com/ekistece/wine-lol
    After installing both wine-lol and wine-lol-glibc, change the wine version of LOL in lutris to custom and enter this path: /opt/wine-lol/bin/wine

Disclaimer

    If the game crash with some message that saids core dump... just press OK and wait a bit, the game will continue at the exact state
